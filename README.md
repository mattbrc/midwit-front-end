## The Maths

Your base score is calculated out of 20 questions. The calculation for your IQ is not accurate and obviously not your true IQ score. A traditional IQ test uses thousands and thousands of other test takers of the exact same test to get a point of reference for average, or an IQ of 100 shown on the bell curve below.
